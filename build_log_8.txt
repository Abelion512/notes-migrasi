Type error: No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(options: Partial<EditorOptions> & { immediatelyRender?: boolean | undefined; shouldRerenderOnTransaction?: boolean | undefined; } & { immediatelyRender: false; }, deps?: DependencyList | undefined): Editor | null', gave the following error.
    Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'immediateRender' does not exist in type 'Partial<EditorOptions> & { immediatelyRender?: boolean | undefined; shouldRerenderOnTransaction?: boolean | undefined; } & { immediatelyRender: false; }'. Did you mean to write 'immediatelyRender'?
  Overload 2 of 2, '(options: UseEditorOptions, deps?: DependencyList | undefined): Editor', gave the following error.
    Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'immediateRender' does not exist in type 'UseEditorOptions'. Did you mean to write 'immediatelyRender'?
